# Chocolate-Model

1) To install tensorflow and other libraries I have created a virtual environment in anaconda env folder
2) From there I opened the jupyter notebook
3) Then I imported several libraries and performed all the tasks associated with the assignment
4) The final model has been saved as model.pickle file in the main folder
